# STPT Protocol Specification

Status: draft.

# 1	Terminology
- **Endpoint** — an implementation instance of the STPT protocol. Within a Connection it acts in exactly one role: Client or Server.
- **Client** — the Endpoint role that initiates a Connection.
- **Server** — the Endpoint role that accepts Connections and hosts Sessions.
- **Connection** — a secure transport connection between a Client and a Server. A Connection is not bound to a network path: an address change of an Endpoint does not create a new Connection. Mapping to QUIC and TLS 1.3: PB001.
- **Channel** — a logical service within a Connection: control, terminal, files or another service.
- **Stream** — a transport unit within a Connection carrying data of one Channel. Mapping of Channels to Streams: PB003, PB004.
- **Identity** — a long-term cryptographic identity. A **Server Identity** identifies a Server; a **User Identity** identifies a user.
- **Account** — an operating system account on the Server.
- **Authentication Context** — the result of user authentication on a Connection: authenticated User Identity, mapped Account and granted permissions.
- **Session** — a server-side execution context owned by an Account: processes and, for interactive use, a terminal (PTY). It is accessed through Channels of an attached Connection; the terminal is one such Channel. The lifetime of a Session does not depend on any Connection.
- **Attachment** — a temporary, authorized binding of a Connection to a Session. An Attachment ends no later than its Connection.
- **Retention Policy** — the Server policy determining how long a Session exists without any Attachment.

# 2	Concept model
```
Client ──── Connection ──── Server
              │  0..1 Authentication Context ── Account
              │  1..N Channel ── 1..N Stream
              │
          Attachment ──── Session ──── Account
                     (Server hosts 0..N Sessions)
```
- A Connection has exactly one Client and one Server.
- A Connection has at most one Authentication Context, established by user authentication (PB008).
- A Connection carries Channels; each Channel uses one or more Streams.
- A Server hosts zero or more Sessions; each Session is owned by exactly one Account.
- An Attachment links one Connection with one Session and requires an Authentication Context on that Connection. The number of Attachments per Connection and per Session: PD003.
- The end of a Connection ends its Channels and Attachments, but not its Sessions. A Session ends by termination or by Retention Policy (§3.2, PD002).

# 3	State model
States are abstract; their wire representation is defined in later items (PB003, PD).

## 3.1	Connection
Each Endpoint keeps its own Connection state.

| From | To | Event |
|---|---|---|
| Handshaking | Established | QUIC/TLS handshake, HELLO and negotiation succeeded |
| Established | Authenticated | user authentication succeeded; Authentication Context created |
| any | Closed | close by either Endpoint, error, idle timeout, failed handshake or authentication |

- Handshaking: QUIC/TLS handshake, HELLO, version and capability negotiation.
- Established: the channel is secure; the user is not authenticated; only the control Channel is available.
- Authenticated: an Authentication Context exists; other Channels and Attachments are available.
- Closed: final. Connection loss is a close reason, not a separate state.
- Connection migration does not change the state.

## 3.2	Session
The Server holds the authoritative Session state.

| From | To | Event |
|---|---|---|
| Starting | Running | processes started |
| Starting | Terminated | start failed |
| Running | Exited | the primary process exited |
| Running | Terminating | termination requested by an authorized Client or by Server policy |
| Terminating | Terminated | all processes ended |
| Exited | Terminated | removal by an authorized Client or by Retention Policy |

- Running: processes run; terminal I/O is available through Attachments.
- Exited: processes ended; the exit status and possibly the last output are kept for later Attachments.
- Terminated: final; resources released.
- Attached / detached is not a state: a Session is detached while it has no Attachment. A detached Session in Running or Exited is subject to Retention Policy.

## 3.3	Attachment
`Active → Ended`.
- An Attachment comes into existence Active only after successful authorization; there is no pending state.
- End reasons: detach, Connection closed, Session Terminated, permissions revoked.

## 3.4	Invariants
- An Attachment is Active only while its Connection is Authenticated and its Session is Running or Exited.
- Closing a Connection ends all its Attachments but does not change the state of any Session.
- Closed and Terminated are final; a Session ID is never reused.

# 4	Responsibility boundaries
- The Server is the authority for Session and Attachment state; the Client holds a copy.
- Each Endpoint is the authority for its own Connection state.
- The Client requests attach, detach and termination; the Server authorizes them.
- The Server alone sets and applies Retention Policy and may terminate a Session by its own policy.
